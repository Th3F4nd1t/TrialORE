## Conducting trials

1. Start the trial with `/trial start [username] [app url]`.
The username is the user's IGN and the app URL is the discourse URL.
2. Once in trial mode, you can conduct the trial "as normal".
Notes can be written by running `/trial note add [note]` or `/trialnote [note]`.
This will save this note to this trial, and will be included on the trial report.
To edit notes, run `/trial note list` or `/trialnotes` and use the pencil or x to edit or delete a note.
3. To finish a trial, you can run `/trial finish pass` (`/trialpass`) or `/trial finish fail` (`/trialfail`).
This will either accept the Testificate as Builder, or demote them back to student.

## Abandonment
There is an "abandonment" period for if a Testificate or trialer leave.
This "abandonment" period defaults to 5 minutes.
If a Testificate leaves, they will be demoted to Student and given 5 minutes to rejoin.
If they do not rejoin within those 5 minutes, the trial ends.
If a trialer leaves, the trial will automatically end in 5 minutes if they do not rejoin, demoting the Testificate to Student.
The only distinction of an abandoned trial is if the trial ends with an automated abandonment note.

## AutOREmated Trials
Automated trials are trials in which there is no live testing of the testificate and therefore no requirement of a staff or Engineer being online to run the trial.
